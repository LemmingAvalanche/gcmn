.gitattributes: include `text` attribute for eol attributes

The standard advice for text file eol endings in the .gitattributes file
was updated in e28eae3184 (gitattributes: Document the unified "auto"
handling, 2016-08-26) with a recent clarification in 8c591dbfce (docs:
correct documentation about eol attribute, 2022-01-11), with a follow
up comment by the original author in [1] confirming the use of the eol
attribute in conjunction with the text attribute.

Update Git's .gitattributes file to reflect our own advice.
